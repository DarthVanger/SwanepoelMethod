# Abandoned
Unfortunately the project is abandoned.

It worked quite well, but needs lots of refactoring & bug fix :)

Swanepoel method
=================
This application is an attempt to program Swanepoel's method for finding optical constants of thin films.

Used frameworks
---------------
The app is based on AngularJS javascript framework.

Backend uses Symfony2, but should be changed to something simpler.

All the computations are done on javascript. Php is used only for data files managment.
